D3: World of Bits
Game Design Vision

The player interacts with a fixed map around the classroom. Nearby grid cells can be clicked to collect or craft tokens of increasing value.

Technologies

TypeScript for main game logic

Leaflet for the map interface

Deno + Vite for build and deployment

Assignments
D3.a: Core mechanics

Steps

Create map, control, and status panels

Center the map on the classroom location

Draw a visible grid of fixed-size cells

Show token values directly on each cell

Make cells clickable for interactions

Limit interactions to nearby cells

Implement inventory (hold one token at a time)

Add crafting (equal-value tokens combine → double value)

Detect win when holding a token of value 16
